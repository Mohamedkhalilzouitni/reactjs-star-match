this is a simple game that I built following a React tutorial on Pluralsight. The game is named star match and it's quite straight forward. the game plays as follows :

* a random number of stars appear on the left of the screen.
* the player should select numbers (or a single number) that add up to the number of shown stars.
* a number can only be used once.
* the player should use all the numbers before the game times out.
